	<description>Replace the stuff that a thing is made from, e.g. replace a wall's materials.
	
This mod does NOT deconstruct and reconstruct. It preserves the existing building and replaces materials in-place.

Also, blueprints are allowed over rock and fog.
	
A new button in the Architect/Structure menu to replace any building's materials.
Regular buildings that are ordered to be built on top of a copy are replaced instead of reconstructed.
		
It doesn't break down the existing building, which means:
Replacing walls doesn't break the room, and keeps freezers cold.
Replacing workbenches doesn't delete bills.
